Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, and within this cancer type, triple-negative breast cancers have the worst prognosis. The identification of new genes associated with triple-negative breast cancer progression is crucial for developing more specific anti-cancer targeted therapies, which could lead to a better management of these patients. In this context, we have recently demonstrated that SMARCAD1, a DEAD/H box-containing helicase, is involved in breast cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the stable knockdown of SMARCAD1 on human breast cancer cell progression.
