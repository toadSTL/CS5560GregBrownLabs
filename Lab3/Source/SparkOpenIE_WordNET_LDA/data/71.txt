OBJECTIVE To review the recent data considering the expression profile and the role of microRNAs in breast tumorigenesis, and their impact on -the vital for breast cancer progression- angiogenesis. METHODS PubMed was searched for studies focused on data that associate microRNA with breast cancer, using the terms ''breast", "mammary gland", "neoplasia'', "angiogenesis" and ''microRNA'' between 1997-2018. RESULTS Aberrant expression of several circulating and tissue miRNAs is observed in human breast neoplasms with the deregulation of several miRNAs having a major participation in breast cancer progression. Angiogenesis seems to be directly affected by either overexpression or down regulation of many miRNAs, defining the overall prognostic rates. Many miRNAs differentially expressed in breast cancer that reveal a key role in suppression - progression and metastasis of breast cancer along with the contribution of the EGF, TNF-a and EGF cytokines. CONCLUSION Angiogenesis has proven to be vital for tumor development and metastasis while microRNAs are proposed to have multiple biological roles, including participation in immunosuppressive, immunomodulatory and recent studies reveal their implication in angiogenesis and its possible use as prognostic factors in cancer Even though larger studies are needed in order to reach safe conclusions, important steps are made that reveal the connection of serum microRNA expression to the angiogenic course of breast cancer, while miRNAs could be potential prognostic factors for the different breast cancer types.
