Brain metastases are the most common intracranial tumors in adults.
They usually origin from: lung, breast, renal cell, and gastrointestinal cancers, as well as melanoma.
Prognosis for brain metastases is still poor and classical treatment combining surgery and radiation therapy should be strongly supported with molecular approaches.
However, their successful application depends on a deep understanding of not only genetic, but also epigenetic background of the disease.
That will result in earlier and more precise diagnosis, successful treatment, as well as individualized estimation of clinical outcomes and prognosis.
It has already been shown that the epigenetic machinery plays a crucial role in cancer biology, development and progression.
Therefore, we decided to look for metastasis through changes of the most studied epigenetic mark, 5-methylcytosine in DNA.
We performed global analysis of the 5-methylcytosine contents in DNA isolated from brain metastatic tumor tissue and peripheral blood samples of the same patients, using thin layer chromatography separation of radioactively labelled nucleotides.We found that the 5-methylcytosine level in DNA from brain metastases changes in the broad range, overlaps with that of blood, and negatively correlates with the increasing tumor grade.
Because the amount of 5-methylcytosine in tumor tissue and blood is almost identical, the genomic DNA methylation can be useful marker for brain metastases detection and differentiation.
Our research create a scope for future studies on epigenetic mechanisms in neurooncology, and can lead to development new diagnostic methods in clinical practice.
