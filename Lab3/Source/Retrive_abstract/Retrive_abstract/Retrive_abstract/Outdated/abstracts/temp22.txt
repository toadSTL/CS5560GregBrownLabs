Fibrotic tumor stroma (FTS) has been implicated in cancer promotion in several neoplasms. The histological features of FTS are convenient and easily accessible in clinical routine in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) specimens. The goal of this study was to explore prognostic impacts of the quantity and maturity of FTS on surgical ICC patients. Moreover, we aimed to propose an efficient prognostic nomogram for postoperative ICC patients.
