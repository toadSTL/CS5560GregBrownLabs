The enzyme inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) catalyzes an essential step in the de novo biosynthesis of guanine nucleotides, and thus regulates the guanine nucleotide pool required for cell proliferation.
Of the two isoforms, human IMPDH type 2 (hIMPDH2) is a validated molecular target for potential immunosuppressive, antiviral and anticancer chemotherapy.
In search of newer hIMPDH2 inhibitors as potential anticancer agents, three novel series (A: 5-aminoisobenzofuran-1(3H)-one, B: 3,4-dimethoxyaniline and C: benzo[d]-[1,3]dioxol-5-ylmethanamine) were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro and cell-based activities.
A total of 37 molecules (29-65) were screened for their in vitro hIMPDH2 inhibition, with particular emphasis on establishing their structure-activity relationship (SAR) trends.
Eight compounds (hits, 30, 31, 33-35, 37, 41 and 43) demonstrated significant enzyme inhibition (>70% @ 10 μM); especially the A series molecules were more potent than B series (<70% inhibition @ 10 μM), while C series members were found to be inactive.
