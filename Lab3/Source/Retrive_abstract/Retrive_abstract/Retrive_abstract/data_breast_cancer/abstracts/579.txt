Recent studies suggested an important relationship between tumor stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) and cancer. However, the expression of STIP1 in breast cancer tissues and its relationship with clinical characteristics and survival have not been investigated in humans. The aim of our work was to evaluate the association of STIP1 and the prognosis of breast cancer patients.
