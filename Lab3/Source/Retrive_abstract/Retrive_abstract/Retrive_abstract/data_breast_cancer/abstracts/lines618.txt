Cystosarcoma phyllodes of the breast, an uncommon sarcoma found primarily in women of the age group of 35-55 years, constitutes <1% of all breast neoplasms.
These tumors are resistant to chemotherapy and hormonal therapies and often recur aggressively after initial surgery.
Limited research is available about the role and effectiveness of adjuvant radiotherapy in reducing recurrences.
