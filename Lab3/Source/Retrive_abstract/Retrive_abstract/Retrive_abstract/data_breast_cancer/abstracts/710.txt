Implant-based immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) is the most common technique for post-mastectomy reconstructions in the United Kingdom (UK). Subpectoral implant placement is the conventional method of reconstruction. Placement of implant in the subcutaneous pocket covered by an acellular dermal matrix (ADM) is a relatively recent approach. We report a comparative analysis of prepectoral versus subpectoral approach for implant-based IBR from a single institution in the UK.
