Overcoming resistance to antimitotic drugs, such as paclitaxel (PTX), would represent a major advance in breast cancer treatment. PTX induces mitotic block and sensitive cells exit mitosis dying by mitotic catastrophe. Resistant cells remain in block and continue proliferation after drug decay, denoting one of the PTX resistance mechanisms. Mild hyperthermia (HT) triggers mitotic exit of PTX-pretreated cells, overcoming PTX resistance and suggesting HT-forced mitotic exit as a promising strategy to potentiate PTX.
