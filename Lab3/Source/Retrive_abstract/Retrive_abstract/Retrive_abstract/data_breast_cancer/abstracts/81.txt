Mucoepidermoid carcinomas (MEC) are the most common malignant neoplasms of salivary glands but are uncommon in other sites. Salivary gland MEC are most frequently associated with CRTC1-MAML2 translocations. Exceedingly rare MEC of the breast demonstrate a basal-like and often triple (estrogen and progesterone receptor, HER2) negative immunophenotype, with a single case previously reported to show MAML2 rearrangement, although the fusion partner was not known. Comprehensive genomic studies of breast MEC are lacking. In this study, we analyzed the immunophenotype and molecular landscape of two breast MEC to elucidate the pathogenesis of these rare tumors.
