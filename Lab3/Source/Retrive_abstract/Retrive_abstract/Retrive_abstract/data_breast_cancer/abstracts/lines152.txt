Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are a rare and heterogeneous group of tumors, with a variety of primary origins and variable aggressiveness.
NENs with an atypical primary origin, such as breast and retroperitoneal NENs, are extremely rare.
As a consequence, an established diagnostic and therapeutic strategy in this particular subgroup is lacking.
The combination of capecitabineandtemozolomide, called CAPTEM regimen, has produced promising response rates in patients with grade1 or 2neuroendocrine tumors of multiple origins.
