Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a standard axillary surgery in early breast cancer.
If the SLNB result is positive, subsequent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is a routine procedure.
In 2011, the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial revealed that ALND may not be necessary in early breast cancer with one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes.
The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes among Korean patients with one or two positive axillary lymph nodes in the final pathology who did and did not undergo ALND.
