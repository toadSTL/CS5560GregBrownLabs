Combined anthracycline-trastuzumab chemotherapy has been associated with LV dysfunction.
We aimed to assess early changes in left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) mechanics associated with combined anthracycline-trastuzumab treatment for breast cancer.
As well as explore whether early changes in 2-dimensional (2D)-speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) could predict later chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity.
