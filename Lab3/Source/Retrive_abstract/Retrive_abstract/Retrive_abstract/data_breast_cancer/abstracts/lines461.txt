Breast cancer is the first noticeable disease in female patients.
Long-term use of soybean (Glycine max) may prevent the progression of cancer.
However, the molecular mechanism for the functions of soybean remains unclear.
Histone demethylase JMJD5, an important epigenetic molecule, is overexpressed in the progression of breast cancer suggesting that soybean may ameliorate cancer by affecting the expression of JMJD5.
