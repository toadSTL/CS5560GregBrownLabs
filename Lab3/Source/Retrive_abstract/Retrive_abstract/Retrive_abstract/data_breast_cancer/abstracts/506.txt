Dose-dense chemotherapy (DD-CT) is a preferred (neo) adjuvant regimen in early breast cancer (BC). Although the results of reported randomized trials are conflicting, a recent meta-analysis showed improved overall and disease-free survival with DD-CT compared to conventional schedules. However, no DD-CT safety data for Korean BC patients are available. This phase II study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pegteograstim in Korean BC patients receiving DD-CT.
