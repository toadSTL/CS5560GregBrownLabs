Mortality from breast cancer is usually attributable to metastasis.
In vitro data suggest that amide local anaesthetics, e.g.
lidocaine, inhibit metastasis by multiple mechanisms and recent in vivo data support this.
Experimental data also suggest that opioids may inhibit cisplatin chemotherapy.
Whether lidocaine would influence cisplatin chemotherapy has not been evaluated.
