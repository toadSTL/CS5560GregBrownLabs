Clips are often placed to mark axillary nodes with biopsy-confirmed metastases in patients with breast cancer. The evaluation of clipped nodes after chemotherapy can identify patients who have eradication of nodal disease. The goal of this study was to determine whether preoperative fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of clipped nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) could predict the presence of residual disease.
