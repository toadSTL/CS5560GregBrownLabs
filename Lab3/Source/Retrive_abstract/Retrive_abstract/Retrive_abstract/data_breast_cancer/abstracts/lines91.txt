Enhanced biocompatibility of nanosized contrast agent with high radiodensity and specific bio-distribution is an important parameter for localized tumor imaging and organ safety.
Various nanoparticles, especially gold nanorods (GNRs) have been applied for tumor diagnosis.
However, their toxicity, nonspecific bio-distribution and easy aggregation are critical issues in cancer medicine.
To avoid these issues, the GNRs are encapsulated in the core of nanoscopic mesoporous silica (MS) under ambient conditions, yielding multifunctional nanomaterials for cancer nanomedicine, is a recent and active development.
Interestingly, GNRs embedded MS nanohybrid (GNR-MS) though promising materials in nanomedicine is rarely examined for tumor diagnosis, in vivo toxicity, organs safety, contrast ability and excretion.
Herein, we report a systematic in vivo examination of folic acid functionalized GNR-MS (GNR-MS-FA) for localized 4T1 breast tumor diagnosis, organ safety and excretion using a onetime dose administration.
The nanomaterials show good aqueous dispersibility, biocompatibility, high radiodensity and tumor specific targeting ability (in vitro as well as in vivo).
The in vivo tumor diagnosis and specific bio-distribution of injected nanomaterials clearly demonstrates their potential for the visualization of tumors deep in the body of mice.
In addition, all organs including the healthy glomerulus of kidney are observed to be free of the tissue injuries thereby indicating the superior biocompatibility of the nanomaterials.
