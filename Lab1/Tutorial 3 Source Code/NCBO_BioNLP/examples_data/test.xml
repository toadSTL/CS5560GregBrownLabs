            <passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>58</offset><text>People are at higher risk for malignancy as they get older or have a strong family history of cancer. This study aims to collect family history of cancer in a large cohort of patients with pituitary adenomas (PA) in outpatient clinic from years 2005-2017. Overall, 46.6% of 1062 patients with PA had a family member affected with cancer. Breast cancer in family members was reported in 15.3% of patients with prolactinomas which was significantly higher than in families of patients with non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA) (10.0%) or acromegaly (6.8%) (p = 0.004). Lung cancer in family members was reported in 12.1% of patients with prolactinomas, significantly higher than in families of NFPA patients (7.0%, p = 0.049). Colorectal cancer in relatives of patients with PA was reported with any type of PA. Furthermore, patients with a positive family history of malignancy were diagnosed with PA at an earlier age than patients with a negative family history (43.6 +- 15.9 vs 46.0 +- 16.4 years, p = 0.015). Female patients with prolactinoma are more commonly diagnosed before the age of 25 years. Forty-two percent of patients with PA diagnosed before the age of 25 years had a second- and third-degree relative with cancer, significantly higher than patients with PA diagnosed later in life (25.8%, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Breast, lung, and colon cancers in second- and third-degree relatives were reported in significantly higher proportion of patients with PA diagnosed before the age of 25 years, compared with patients with PA diagnosed later in life (breast cancer: 10.9 vs 6.1%, p = 0.033; lung cancer: 10.9 vs 5.8%, p = 0.02; colon cancer: 9.5 vs 4.0%, p = 0.004). These results suggest familial cancer clustering in patients with prolactinoma and young patients with PA (younger than 25 years at diagnosis of PA). In particular, there is a strong association between prolactinoma and family history of breast and lung cancers. Further research of possible shared genetic susceptibility of prolactinoma and breast and lung cancers is needed.</text><annotation id="0"><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="582" length="4"/><text>NFPA</text></annotation><annotation id="1"><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="755" length="4"/><text>NFPA</text></annotation></passage>

            <passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>50</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Despite a trend for less radical surgical approaches in breast cancer due to better understanding of tumour biology and new treatment options such as neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and intra-operative radiotherapy (IORT), seroma production remains one of the main surgical side effects that can result in prolonged recovery, delay of radiotherapy and patient discomfort. The aim of this study is to provide an update on risk factors for seroma production after breast cancer surgery considering the latest treatment options. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of seroma production in primary breast cancer patients treated between 01.01.2010 and 31.12.2014 at the Breast Cancer Centre, University Hospital Ulm, was performed. Patients with previous breast/axillary surgery or more than one intervention were excluded. Seroma formation was measured using wound drains placed in breast and axilla. RESULTS: In total, 581 patients met the inclusion criteria. Median age at diagnosis was 60 years, and median BMI 25.6 kg/m2. 60 (10.3%) patients had a mastectomy, 175 (30.1%) patients received IORT, and 72 (12.4%) patients received NAC. Median amount of seroma production was 82.5 ml (range 0-3012.5 ml). Multivariate analysis revealed that most of the observed variation in seroma production was due to type of surgery (mastectomy vs. breast conserving), length of surgery and number of removed lymph nodes. Both NAC and IORT explained a significant but very small amount of the observed variation in seroma production. CONCLUSION: The most important factors for seroma production are extent and duration of breast surgery.</text><annotation id="0"><infon key="identifier">MESH:C086501</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="238" length="3"/><text>NAC</text></annotation><annotation id="1"><infon key="identifier">MESH:C086501</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="1471" length="3"/><text>NAC</text></annotation></passage>

            <passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>54</offset><text>MRI of the breast is the most sensitive test for breast cancer detection and outperforms conventional imaging with mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis, or ultrasound. However, the long scan time and relatively high costs limit its widespread use. Hence, it is currently only routinely implemented in the screening of women at an increased risk of breast cancer. To overcome these limitations, abbreviated dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI protocols have been introduced that substantially shorten image acquisition and interpretation time while maintaining a high diagnostic accuracy. Efforts to develop abbreviated MRI protocols reflect the increasing scrutiny of the disproportionate contribution of radiology to the rising overall healthcare expenditures. Healthcare policy makers are now focusing on curbing the use of advanced imaging examinations such as MRI while continuing to promote the quality and appropriateness of imaging. An important cornerstone of value-based healthcare defines value as the patient's outcome over costs. Therefore, the concept of a fast, abbreviated MRI exam is very appealing, given its high diagnostic accuracy coupled with the possibility of a marked reduction in the cost of an MRI examination. Given recent concerns about gadolinium-based contrast agents, unenhanced MRI techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) are also being investigated for breast cancer diagnosis. Although further larger prospective studies, standardized imaging protocol, and reproducibility studies are necessary, initial results with abbreviated MRI protocols suggest that it seems feasible to offer screening breast DCE-MRI to a broader population. This article aims to give an overview of abbreviated and fast breast MRI protocols, their utility for breast cancer detection, and their emerging role in the new value-based healthcare paradigm that has replaced the fee-for-service model.

            <passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>42</offset><text>The recent Danish cohort study reported a 20% increased risk of breast cancer among current and recent hormonal contraception users. These results are largely consistent with previous studies. This study did not report on stage of disease at diagnosis, and it is not clear to what extent the apparent increased risk may be due to a small advance in the timing of diagnosis. This study did not report on the risk associated with the use of a 20-mcg ethinyl estradiol pill. They did find an increasing risk in current users of longer duration and an increased risk with use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system-both of these potentially important findings have not been consistently found in previous studies and require further investigation. The breast cancer effects described now in multiple studies wane with time, and in the long term, hormonal contraception use has been found not to be associated with any increased total cancer risk.</text><annotation id="0"><infon key="identifier">MESH:D004997</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="490" length="17"/><text>ethinyl estradiol</text></annotation><annotation id="1"><infon key="identifier">MESH:D016912</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="621" length="14"/><text>levonorgestrel</text></annotation></passage>

            <passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>97</offset><text>BACKGROUND: CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor frequently overexpressed in invasive breast cancer that has been shown to play a major role in signaling pathways involved in metastasis. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to assess the diagnostic performance of CXCR4-directed PET imaging in patients with breast cancer using the recently introduced CXCR4-targeted PET probe 68Ga-Pentixafor. RESULTS: Thirteen patients with first diagnosis of breast cancer, four patients with recurrent disease after primary breast cancer, and one patient with axillary lymph node metastasis of unknown primary underwent CXCR4-targeted PET imaging using 68Ga-Pentixafor. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) and tumor-to-background (T/B) ratios of tumor lesions were measured and compared with pathological prognostic factors and molecular subtypes. 18F-FDG PET/CT images were available in 8/18 cases and were compared semi-quantitatively. Comparison with CXCR4 expression determined by immunohistochemistry was performed in 7/18 patients. Nine of 13 primary breast cancers were visually detectable on 68Ga-Pentixafor PET images (mean SUVmax of 3.0). The visually undetectable lesions included both cases of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and two cases of invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST) without any hormone receptor and HER2 expression (triple negative). Metastases of recurrent breast cancer and unknown primary cancer were visually detectable in all five cases, exhibiting a mean SUVmax of 3.5. 18F-FDG PET demonstrated higher SUVmax in all patients compared to 68Ga-Pentixafor PET. A correlation between SUVmax obtained from 68Ga-Pentixafor PET and prognostic factors including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, proliferation index, tumor grade, or molecular subtypes was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: CXCR4-directed PET imaging in patients with primary and recurrent breast cancer is feasible; however, tumor detectability is significantly lower compared to 18F-FDG PET. Moreover, we did not find any correlation between aforementioned prognostic factors of breast cancer and CXCR4-targeted tracer accumulation. Based on these results in a small patient cohort, CXCR4-targeted PET imaging does not seem to be suitable as a general diagnostic tool for imaging of breast cancer. Future CXCR4 imaging studies should investigate whether this modality might be useful in more specific applications, e.g., in therapeutic approaches especially under the view of current developments in targeted immune cell and immune checkpoint inhibitory therapy.</text><annotation id="1"><infon key="identifier">MESH:D019788</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="1603" length="9"/><text>F-FDG PET</text></annotation><annotation id="2"><infon key="identifier">MESH:D004967</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="1785" length="8"/><text>estrogen</text></annotation><annotation id="3"><infon key="identifier">MESH:D011374</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="1809" length="12"/><text>progesterone</text></annotation><annotation id="4"><infon key="identifier">MESH:D019788</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="2139" length="9"/><text>F-FDG PET</text></annotation></passage>

            <passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset><text>Conventional X-ray mammography has low diagnostic sensitivity for women with dense breasts. As a result, alternative contrast-enhanced screening tools such as dual energy mammography (DEM), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging are being used or investigated for these women. However, currently available contrast agents are non-ideal, have safety issues, and each imaging technique requires a different contrast agent. We therefore sought to develop a multimodal contrast agent that is functional for each breast imaging modality to simplify the diagnosis process and address the issues of existing contrast agents. Herein, we present a novel "all-in-one" nanoparticle (AION) multimodal imaging probe that has potent DEM, CT, MRI, and NIRF contrast properties and improved biocompatibility. AION were formed by co-encapsulation of a near-infrared fluorophore (DiR), silver sulfide nanoparticles (Ag2S-NP), and iron oxide nanoparticles (IO-NP) in PEGylated micelles. AION showed negligible cytotoxicity, which was in agreement with its minimal silver ion release profiles. AION generated strong contrast with all imaging modalities as demonstrated in phantom imaging. AION allowed in vivo tumor imaging as evidenced by the increase in contrast after injection. This study indicates the potential of AION as an effective multimodal contrast agent for breast cancer diagnosis with a range of imaging methods.</text><annotation id="1"><infon key="identifier">MESH:C541280</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="893" length="3"/><text>DEM</text></annotation><annotation id="2"><infon key="identifier">MESH:C120688</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="1023" length="11"/><text>fluorophore</text></annotation><annotation id="3"><infon key="identifier">MESH:C013251</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="1042" length="14"/><text>silver sulfide</text></annotation><annotation id="4"><infon key="identifier">MESH:D012834</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="1072" length="4"/><text>Ag2S</text></annotation><annotation id="5"><infon key="identifier">MESH:C000499</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="1086" length="10"/><text>iron oxide</text></annotation><annotation id="6"><infon key="identifier">MESH:C039441</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="1122" length="9"/><text>PEGylated</text></annotation><annotation id="7"><infon key="identifier">MESH:D012834</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="1219" length="6"/><text>silver</text></annotation></passage>

            <passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>77</offset><text>BACKGROUND: The association between vitamin A intake and breast cancer survival has been inconsistent. We conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis to summarize the results on the association between dietary or supplement vitamin A and its derivatives and breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival (OS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed and EMBASE was performed from inception to January 31, 2018. The summary hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using a random effects model. RESULTS: Ten studies (8 cohort, 1 clinical trial, and 1 of pooled studies), with 19,450 breast cancer cases, were included in the meta-analysis. The dietary intake of beta-carotene was significantly associated with improved breast cancer OS, with a summary hazard ratio of 0.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.99; I2 = 37.5%) for the highest versus lowest intake and 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.88-0.99; I2 = 38.7%) per 1200 mug/day increment of intake when assessing diet before diagnosis. Meta-regression analysis showed that adjustment for body mass index was a modified factor for the association between the intake of beta-carotene and breast cancer OS (P = .013). However, the intake of other vitamin A derivatives (eg, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, retinol, lutein) had no effect on breast cancer prognosis when assessing diet before and after the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest limited evidence for the significantly inverse association between the prediagnosis dietary intake of beta-carotene and OS among women with breast cancer. However, the intake of other vitamin A derivatives was not significantly associated with survival.</text><annotation id="1"><infon key="identifier">MESH:D014801</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="113" length="9"/><text>vitamin A</text></annotation><annotation id="2"><infon key="identifier">MESH:D014801</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="303" length="9"/><text>vitamin A</text></annotation><annotation id="3"><infon key="identifier">MESH:D019207</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="780" length="13"/><text>beta-carotene</text></annotation><annotation id="4"><infon key="identifier">MESH:D019207</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="1242" length="13"/><text>beta-carotene</text></annotation><annotation id="5"><infon key="identifier">MESH:D014801</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="1318" length="9"/><text>vitamin A</text></annotation><annotation id="6"><infon key="identifier">MESH:C041635</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="1345" length="14"/><text>alpha-carotene</text></annotation><annotation id="7"><infon key="identifier">MESH:D065366</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="1361" length="18"/><text>beta-cryptoxanthin</text></annotation><annotation id="8"><infon key="identifier">MESH:C015329</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="1381" length="8"/><text>lycopene</text></annotation><annotation id="9"><infon key="identifier">MESH:D014801</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="1391" length="7"/><text>retinol</text></annotation><annotation id="10"><infon key="identifier">MESH:D019207</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="1636" length="13"/><text>beta-carotene</text></annotation><annotation id="11"><infon key="identifier">MESH:D014801</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="1718" length="9"/><text>vitamin A</text></annotation></passage>

            <passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>84</offset><text>Breast cancer is a very complex and heterogeneous disease with variable molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis and clinical behaviors. The identification of prognostic risk factors may enable effective diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. In particular, numerous gene-expression-based prognostic signatures were developed and some of them have already been applied into clinical trials and practice. In this study, we summarized several representative gene-expression-based signatures with significant prognostic value and separately assessed their ability of prognosis prediction in their originally targeted populations of breast cancer. Notably, many of the collected signatures were originally designed to predict the outcomes of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) patients or the whole breast cancer cohort; there are no typical signatures used for the prognostic prediction in a specific population of patients with the intrinsic subtype. We thus attempted to identify subtype-specific prognostic signatures via a computational framework for analyzing multi-omics profiles and patient survival. For both the discovery and an independent data set, we confirmed that subtype-specific signature is a strong and significant independent prognostic factor in the corresponding cohort. These results indicate that the subtype-specific prognostic signature has a much higher resolution in the risk stratification, which may lead to improved therapies and precision medicine for patients with breast cancer.</text><annotation id="0"><infon key="identifier">MESH:D004967</infon><infon key="type">Chemical</infon><location offset="823" length="8"/><text>estrogen</text></annotation></passage>

            <passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>140</offset><text>Traumatic neuroma of the breast after cancer surgery is a very rare clinical entity with only a few cases having been reported to date. We herein present a very rare case of traumatic breast neuroma in a postmenopausal patient with a history of breast-conserving surgery, who presented with a four-month history of intractable neuropathic breast pain. Diagnostic evaluation and management are discussed along with a review of the literature. Traumatic breast neuromas are very rare benign lesions that have been reported mainly after mastectomy. Our literature review yielded only 35 cases of traumatic breast neuromas in 28 patients, reported so far. Although imaging features may be indicative of a benign lesion, surgical excision is necessary to obtain a definitive diagnosis and to rule out a recurrent breast cancer. Conservative treatment is feasible in properly selected cases with asymptomatic neuromas after an accurate tissue sampling. The case presented herein underlines the necessity to consider traumatic neuroma in the differential diagnosis in patients with a history of breast surgery presenting with refractory neuropathic breast pain. A high index of suspicion is required because the lesion may be too small and can be missed on imaging investigations.</text></passage>

            <passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>74</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Management of locally-advanced breast cancer is determined by multiple factors, but in patients without distant metastases often involves neoadjuvant systemic therapy, surgery and radiation. If the primary tumour remains unresectable following systemic therapy, radiotherapy may be used for tumour shrinkage prior to surgery. When metastatic disease is present, locoregional radiotherapy is generally reserved for management of tumour-related symptoms. We reviewed our experience of high-dose radiotherapy for unresected locally-advanced breast cancer. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients with unresected locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) receiving external beam radiotherapy to the breast, chest wall and/or regional lymph nodes. Patients were stratified based on the presence of metastatic disease at presentation. Patient demographics, disease characteristics, and treatment outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Forty-three cases were analyzed between 2004 and 2016. Median follow-up was 25 months from diagnosis and 14 months from completion of radiotherapy. There were 24 cases (56%) with metastatic disease on presentation, and 19 (44%) without. Tumour shrinkage occurred within 3 months of completing radiotherapy in 36 cases (84%). Ulceration and bleeding improved following radiotherapy in 13 (54%) of the 24 applicable cases. Twenty-six patients (60%) developed moist desquamation but none experienced grade 4 or 5 radiation dermatitis. Median locoregional progression-free survival for all patients was 12 months from completion of radiotherapy. Locoregional progression-free survival (P=0.2) and overall survival (OS) (P=0.4) were not significantly different between patients with and without distant metastases at presentation. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy provided good response and symptom control in most patients in this study; there is a role for palliative radiotherapy in patients with LABC.</text></passage>
