Progranulin is a growth and survival factor implicated in tumorigenesis and drug resistance.
Several studies showed that progranulin is expressed in breast cancer tissue and inversely correlates with survival.
B lymphocyte chemoattractant, also known as B cell-attracting chemokine 1 (BCA-1), is a member of the CXC subtype of the chemokine superfamily.
BCA-1 is critical for secondary lymphoid tissue development and navigation of lymphocytes within the microcompartments of the tissue.
There are no data on the content of progranulin and BCA-1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.
To study this issue, we measured BALF content of progranulin and BCA-1 in 46 NSCLC patients before chemotherapy and 15 healthy subjects.
Both markers were elevated in cancer patients compared to healthy subjects (progranulin: 61.4 (1.6-384.0) vs.
6.5 (0.6-12.9) ng/ml, p = 0.001 and BCA-1: 30.8 (24.3-70.8) vs.
15.4 (13.3-19.5) pg/ml, p = 0.0001).
The cut-off BALF level concerning NSCLC vs.
controls, investigated using the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve, yielded 6.5 ng/ml for progranulin and 15.4 pg/ml for BCA-1.
We failed to find any association between the BALF content of progranulin or BCA-1 and the stage of tumor or prospectively assessed treatment response.
However, BALF progranulin associated with time to tumor progression (r = 0.61; p = 0.04).
In addition, a higher BALF content of BCA-1 in NSCLC patients associated with shorter overall survival.
We conclude that progranulin and BCA-1 in BALF of NSCLC patients before chemotherapy may be prognostic factors of cancer progression.
