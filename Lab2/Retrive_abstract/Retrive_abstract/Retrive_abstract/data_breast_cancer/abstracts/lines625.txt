One-third of breast cancer (BC) cases worldwide occur in women aged 65Â years and older, with 10 to 15% overexpressing the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).
Although several HER2-targeted therapies have been developed, the lack of data regarding their use in older patients hampers evidence-based decision-making for this population.
Areas Covered: We review current evidence on the efficacy and safety of HER2-targeted therapies in older adults with BC, focusing on approved therapies such as trastuzumab, lapatinib, pertuzumab, ado-trastuzumab-emtansine, and neratinib.
Additionally, we discuss drugs under development to target the HER2-receptor, and to overcome resistance to existing therapies.
Finally, we highlight the cardiotoxicity of HER2-targeted drugs among older adults.
Expert Opinion: Older adults are underrepresented in trials of HER2-targeted therapies in BC.
We propose strategies to increase recruitment of older adults in clinical trials in order to increase the evidence base to treat this growing population.
