Women with breast cancer report varying frequencies of cognitive problems during adjuvant systemic therapy.
This variability suggests latent subgroups.
Therefore, we identified latent subgroups of self-reported cognitive problems among postmenopausal women with and without breast cancer.
We explored associations between membership in these subgroups and (a) demographic, clinical, and symptom characteristics and (b) variations in candidate gene polymorphisms.
