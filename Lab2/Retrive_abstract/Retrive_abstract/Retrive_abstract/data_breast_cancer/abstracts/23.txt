Anthracycline chemotherapy and left-sided radiation for breast cancer are associated with negative autonomic function changes.
This study's objectives were to characterize changes in, and the association of exercise training with, clinical indices of cardiovascular autonomic function across the trajectory of breast cancer therapy.
