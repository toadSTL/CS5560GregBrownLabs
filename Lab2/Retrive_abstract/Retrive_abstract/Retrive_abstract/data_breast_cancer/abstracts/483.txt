Radial scars (RS) commonly present mammographically as architectural distortions, but these lesions may be associated with non-invasive and invasive breast cancer. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has resulted in higher detection rates of architectural distortion particularly in patients with dense breast tissue. We hypothesized that rates of clinically relevant lesions confirmed surgically would be lower in patients who received DBT imaging compared with those who received standard digital breast imaging.
