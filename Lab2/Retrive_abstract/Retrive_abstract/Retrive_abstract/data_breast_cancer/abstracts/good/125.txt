Multidrug resistance (MDR) remains a major obstacle in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with conventional chemotherapeutic agents. A previous study demonstrated that hsa-miRNA-143-3p plays a vital role in drug resistance of TNBC. Downregulation of hsa-miRNA-143-3p upregulated the expression of its target protein cytokine-induced apoptosis inhibitor 1 (CIAPIN1) in order to activate MDR, while upregulation of hsa-miRNA-143-3p effectively enhances the sensitivity of drug-resistant TNBC cells to chemotherapeutics. The present study aimed to further verify these findings
