Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway activation is associated with resistance to paclitaxel in solid tumors.
We assessed the safety and activity of alpelisib, an oral, selective PI3K p110Î± inhibitor, plus paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors.
This Phase Ib, multicenter, open-label, dose-finding study, with a planned dose-expansion phase of alpelisib once daily (QD) plus fixed-dose paclitaxel, recruited patients with advanced solid tumors.
For the dose-finding phase, the primary objective was determination of maximum tolerated and/or recommended Phase II dose of alpelisib plus paclitaxel, and the secondary objectives included the assessment of safety for this combination.
From March 2014 to August 2016, 19 patients with advanced solid tumors were treated with alpelisib QD (300 mg, n=6; 250 mg, n=4; 150 mg, n=9) plus paclitaxel (80 mg/m
