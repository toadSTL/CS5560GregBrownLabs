Instead we have tried to focus on those areas of clinical practicethat are (i) known to be controversial or uncertain; (ii) where there is identifiable practice variation;(iii) where there is a lack of high-quality evidence; or (iv) where NICE guidelines are likelyto have most impact. More detail on how this was achieved is presented later in the section on‘Developing Clinical Evidence Based Questions’. This guideline is relevant to all healthcare professionals who come into contact with patientswith early breast cancer, as well as to the patients themselves and their carers. It is alsoexpected that the guideline will be of value to those involved in clinical governance in bothprimary and secondary care to help ensure that arrangements are in place to deliver appropriatecare to this group of patients.</AbstractText>            <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2009 National Collaborating Centre for Cancer.</CopyrightInformation>        </Abstract>    </BookDocument>    <PubmedBookData>        <History>            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed">                <Year>2018</Year>                <Month>8</Month>                <Day>14</Day>                <Hour>6</Hour>                <Minute>1</Minute>            </PubMedPubDate>            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline">                <Year>2018</Year>                <Month>8</Month>                <Day>14</Day>                <Hour>6</Hour>                <Minute>1</Minute>            </PubMedPubDate>            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez">                <Year>2018</Year>                <Month>8</Month>                <Day>14</Day>                <Hour>6</Hour>                <Minute>1</Minute>            </PubMedPubDate>        </History>        <PublicationStatus>ppublish</PublicationStatus>        <ArticleIdList>            <ArticleId IdType="pubmed">30102508</ArticleId>        </ArticleIdList>    </PubmedBookData></PubmedBookArticle></PubmedArticleSet>
