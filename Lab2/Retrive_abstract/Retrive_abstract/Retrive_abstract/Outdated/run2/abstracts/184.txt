Robotic surgical systems enhance surgical accuracy and efficiency by applying advanced technologies such as artificial arm joints to provide higher degrees of freedom of movement and high-quality three-dimensional images.
However, the application of robotic surgical systems to breast surgery has not been widely attempted.
The robotic system would improve cosmesis by enabling surgery using a single small incision.
We report the first case of a gasless robot-assisted nipple-sparing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction in a patient with early breast cancer.
