Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is an autosomal-dominantly inherited cancer syndrome associated with a high risk for diffuse gastric and lobular breast cancer, caused by heterozygous CDH1 germline mutations.
Of note, also cleft lip/palate (CLP) has been described in few HDGC families.
Here we report on an extensive pedigree presenting with HDGC, CLP and a CDH1 splice site mutation (c.687 + 1G > A) and review the literature for families with CDH1 mutations, HDGC and CLP.
Transcript analysis showed that the c.687 + 1G > A mutation leads to loss of the last 42 bp of exon 5 and is consequently predicted to cause loss of 14 amino acids in the first extracellular cadherin repeat (EC) domain.
Five mutation carriers developed diffuse gastric cancer and four individuals presented with CLP.
Wild type CDH1 expression levels did not differ between CDH1 mutation carriers with CLP compared to those without CLP.
Beside this extensive pedigree, we outline another previously unreported HDGC/CLP family with a CDH1 (c.1711 + 1G > C) germline mutation in this study.
Review of the literature revealed a significant enrichment of CDH1 mutations within the EC domains in CLP/HDGC families (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.007) in comparison to CDH1 mutations associated with HDGC only.
Report of further CLP/HDGC associated mutations is necessary to confirm this observation.
This study highlights that CLP represents an important phenotypic feature of CDH1 germline mutation carriers and emphasizes the inclusion of CLP in the HDGC testing criteria.
The underlying causes for the appearance of variable phenotypes in CDH1 mutation carriers could include genetic variation, epigenetic changes and environmental factors and should be investigated in future studies.
