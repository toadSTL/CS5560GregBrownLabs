Previous oncological studies showed that lymph node ratio (LNR) (ratio of number of lymph nodes that tested positive for metastasis to the total number of lymph nodes examined) is a negative indicator of cancer survival.
The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system incorporates tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis in a comprehensive model of cancer progression, but LNR alone has been shown to outperform the AJCC system in prognostic and survival predictions for various types of cancer.
The effectiveness of LNR has not been evaluated in breast cancer staging.
Evaluating LNR for predicting cancer staging in breast cancer has the potential to improve treatment recommendations.
